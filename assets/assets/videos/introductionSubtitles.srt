00:00:00,009 --> 00:00:01,240
There. I'm Scott Menor.

1
00:00:01,600 --> 00:00:03,230
I'm a green party candidate running

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:06,090
to represent Arizona's 14th legislative district

3
00:00:06,190 --> 00:00:07,909
which is basically Gilbert Arizona

4
00:00:08,090 --> 00:00:09,050
in the statehouse

5
00:00:09,659 --> 00:00:13,979
I am running because our democracy is fundamentally broken

6
00:00:14,279 --> 00:00:16,870
money to interests control almost everything.

7
00:00:17,129 --> 00:00:19,969
The duopoly has a stranglehold on our government

8
00:00:20,409 --> 00:00:23,510
and the things that government does have almost nothing to

9
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,149
do with the things that we want and care about.

10
00:00:26,729 --> 00:00:27,790
I wanna change that.

11
00:00:28,440 --> 00:00:29,899
My primary goal

12
00:00:30,010 --> 00:00:34,159
when elected is to pass comprehensive electoral reform which

13
00:00:34,169 --> 00:00:37,250
will make it easier to run for office for citizens

14
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:41,549
not require so much money, not require huge amounts of signatures

15
00:00:41,669 --> 00:00:45,380
or huge amounts of time and effort to campaign. I want

16
00:00:45,630 --> 00:00:50,369
everybody who feels called to run and to represent people and

17
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:54,020
who has interests that they want to enact in government.

18
00:00:54,419 --> 00:00:55,740
I want you to have a real chance.

19
00:00:56,220 --> 00:01:01,000
I also want us all to be able to vote for the candidates who best represent us.

20
00:01:01,209 --> 00:01:05,559
I don't want us to feel like we are in a position where we have to strategically vote

21
00:01:05,690 --> 00:01:06,709
for somebody

22
00:01:06,860 --> 00:01:08,709
because the other one is so much worse.

23
00:01:08,959 --> 00:01:09,510
Um

24
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:11,760
That, that sucks. I'm done with it.

25
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:17,529
So whether you're a independent, a green, a democrat or a Republican.

26
00:01:18,180 --> 00:01:19,589
I will represent you.

27
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:24,040
I will talk with you through this. The system is called engage.

28
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:29,389
And uh basically, I'm hoping that you will share this with your friends, family,

29
00:01:29,620 --> 00:01:30,569
neighbors,

30
00:01:30,769 --> 00:01:34,209
particularly people in Gilbert, but it's open to people anywhere,

31
00:01:34,220 --> 00:01:37,199
uh particularly it's useful for people in the uh

32
00:01:37,720 --> 00:01:39,000
in the actual district though.

33
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:42,519
Um And then my goal is after that

34
00:01:42,830 --> 00:01:46,160
to get out of office. I, I do not want to be a career politician.

35
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:47,790
I really uh

36
00:01:48,069 --> 00:01:50,300
it's not my thing. I'm not, I'm not that guy.

37
00:01:50,739 --> 00:01:51,269
Uh

38
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,989
But I, I feel compelled and I feel like somebody needs to do something

39
00:01:56,319 --> 00:01:59,559
and I have some ideas, I think I can do it.

40
00:02:00,069 --> 00:02:00,629
So

41
00:02:00,879 --> 00:02:04,709
thank you for um for paying me attention. Thank you for watching

42
00:02:05,139 --> 00:02:07,290
and I hope we can go on this journey together.

43
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:08,490
Have a good day.
